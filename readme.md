|The EasyTeaching framework is designed to empower robots to learn complex manipulation tasks using a <ins>**limited number of human-operated demonstrations**</ins>. Developed in 2021, the approach aims to simplify robot teaching for **NON-EXPERTS** while overcoming common challenges such as **noisy data, exploration inefficiencies, and the scarcity of demonstration episodes**. |
